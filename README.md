# dg-foursomes-generator
A web-based foursomes/threesomes random generator for disc golf leagues (or regular golf leagues) coded in PHP. No database required.

After years of "flipping discs" and using a deck of playing cards to determine what the foursomes (and threesomes) were going to be at our Sunday afternoon league outings, I decided to see if I could develop a mobile-friendly web application that would allow us to select players as they showed up and let the programming randomly assign players to groups.

Our version is tied to a database-backed scoring system that we use, so the players are plucked from one of those data tables. In this system, the players are entered and selected from a plain TXT file that is managed by someone in the league.

We are trying to raise money to replace the 15+ year old baskets at the course in our local park. If you'd like to help us by kicking in a small contribution toward that goal, please consider a PayPal donation.
